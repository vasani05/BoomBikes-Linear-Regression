## General Information
- Multiple Linear Regression is conducted on the data set. 
- Assignment as part of the machine learning module. 
- Finding different factors which drives the demand of the bikes. 
- BoomBike bike data set is being used in this study.

## Conclusions
- The final R-squared values is 82.2%, which is significantly high since 82.2% variance in the predicted variable is explained by the set of the independent variables.
- The p-value and the VIF of the predictor variable are within the acceptable limits. Moreover, the error terms are normally distributed with mean equal to zero. 
- Bike demand for the BoomBikes is dependent on the temperature and whether it is working day or not, weather condition, and season 
- Based on the above findings, the BoomBikes should consider doing aggressive marketing during Summer and Fall. Moreover, when the weather condition is not clear, there is low demand for the bike, hence they should design a strategy to increase the rentals by incentivising the customers. Rentals were significantly more during 2019 as compared to 2018, hence company should revisit the marketing strategy of 2018 to check how the same could be leveraged to improve the sales.
